pands problemsheet

This repository is used to document the code created as part of the weekly problem sheets as part of the higher diploma in computer Science and data analytics in GMIT. 

Within this repository you will find code created for the following tasks:
1. BMI.py 1. Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py

The inputs are the person's height in centimetres and weight in kilograms.
The output  their BMI (You may need to look up how this is calculated)
$ python bmi.py
Enter weight(kg): 65
Enter height(cm): 180
The BMI is (kg/m2) 20.06.

2. Secondstring.py 
Write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.

$ python secondstring.py
Please enter a sentence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
.o zletrv pu o wr cu h

3. Collatz.py
Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

Have the program end if the current value is one.


Please enter a positive integer: 10

10 5 16 8 4 2 1

4. Weekday.py
rite a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday.

(You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is)

An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.

An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:
It is the weekend, yay!

5. es.py
rite a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. Think about what is being asked here, document any assumptions you are making.

The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. I have not shown you how to do this, you need to look it up.


6. plottask.py
Write a program called plottask.py that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.

Some marks will be given for making the plot look nice.


Previous weekly tasks were done on the repository my-work. The weekly tasks were migrated to the new repository problem sheet for review and assessment submission. There was difficulty in creating both the repositories and multipe calls had to be had to resolve the issue - as a result the weekly tasks were not uploaded weekly however work was done on each task weekly in visual studio code.
